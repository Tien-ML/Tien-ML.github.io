I am freelance researcher in Materials Science, advised by [Assoc. Prof. Le Van Lich](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OH92tWcAAAAJ&hl=en). I spent two wonderful years at Computational Materials Science lab as an researcher, where I was fortunate enough to work under the supervision of [Assoc. Prof. Le Van Lich](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OH92tWcAAAAJ&hl=en) and collaborate with amazing colleagues [Hong-Dang Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=XQHfnsYAAAAJ) and [Dr. Le Van Tuan](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tuan-Le-73).

My research interest lies in the computational and simulation of solidification, precipitation and grain growth.
