I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UCLA, where I will be working with Professor Aditya Grover. I also spent two wonderful years at VinAI Research as an AI Resident, working under the supervision of Dr. Hung Bui and collaborating with my amazing colleagues Rui Shu and Tuan Pham.

My research goal is to develop intelligent agents that are able to perceive, reason and make decisions from high-dimensional and unstructured observations. To achieve this, I have been focusing on unsupervised representation learning, reinforcement learning and deep generative models. I am also interested in applying this research in real-world robots.

Besides research, I love playing soccer in my free time. And I love animals.
