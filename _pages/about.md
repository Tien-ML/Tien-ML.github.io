I am a fresh graduate from Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam. I also work at VinAI Research as an AI Resident, under the supervision of Dr. Hung Bui.

My research goal is to develop intelligent agents that are able to perceive, reason and make decisions from high-dimensional and unstructured observations. To achieve this, I have been focusing on unsupervised representation learning, reinforcement learning and deep generative models. I am also interested in applying this research in real-world robots.

Besides research, I love playing football (soccer) in my free time. And I love animals.
