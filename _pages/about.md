I am a PhD student in Computer Science at UCLA, advised by Aditya Grover. Before my PhD, I spent two wonderful years at VinAI Research as an AI Resident, where I was fortunate enough to work under the supervision of Dr. Hung Bui and collaborate with amazing colleagues Rui Shu and Tuan Pham.

My research goal is to develop intelligent agents that can perceive, reason, and make decisions in highly complex environments. To achieve this, I have been working on the intersection of decision making under uncertainty and sequence modeling. I am also interested in grounding my research in applications to climate change study.
